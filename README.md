- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned

This project was great for me to practise and learn more about positions and max-width properties js objects and so on.I really focused on doing this chart-bars responsive
and lookalike i think i did a pretty decent work i hopu you like it.Feel completely free
to return feedback and change my code cheers!


### Continued development

i tried to code those brown tags without position absolute.But it was breaking my layout
little bit.So position absolute and "display" from "none" to "block" i think is a great
idea i would love to see how you did!
